# Things that are broken (like my brain right now)

- [x] Images for post need reworking. On hover they should turn light gray and this isn't possible with using the svg as an image source. 
- [ ] Implement storage for photos/images
  - [ ] This will need a folder for user profile pictures
  - [x] and a folder for post images
- [ ] On posts, show username not ID (will need to access the user collection)
- [x] Sign in should redirect user to home page.
- [ ] Need to check sign in with email/password - probably need to update code.
