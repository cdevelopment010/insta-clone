# Things that are broken (like my brain right now)

- [x] Images for post need reworking. On hover they should turn light gray and this isn't possible with using the svg as an image source. 
- [x] Implement storage for photos/images
  - [x] This will need a folder for user profile pictures
  - [x] and a folder for post images
- [x] On posts, show username not ID (will need to access the user collection)
- [x] Sign in should redirect user to home page.
- [x] Need to check sign in with email/password - probably need to update code. 
- [x] Re-write home/profile to work within the menu
- [ ] Re-write menu to work for mobile, and to take the children as content.
- [ ] Style new user page
- [ ] Style profile page
- [ ] multi-image posts. 
- [ ] refresh on post created
